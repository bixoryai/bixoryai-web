# BIXORY AI Security Documentation

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin and user roles with proper separation of duties
- **Supabase Authentication**: Secure user authentication with JWT tokens
- **Protected Admin Routes**: Admin functionality requires authentication and admin role verification

### 2. Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all tables with appropriate policies
- **Security Definer Functions**: Used to prevent RLS recursion and ensure secure operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of admin actions and system events
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based rate limiting for newsletter subscriptions (3 attempts per hour)

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Email Validation**: RFC-compliant email validation with length limits
- **HTML Sanitization**: XSS prevention through HTML content sanitization
- **Input Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow and DoS attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Supabase client methods instead of raw SQL

### 4. Edge Function Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers for web security
- **JWT Verification**: Admin functions require JWT authentication
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Input Validation**: All edge functions validate and sanitize inputs

### 5. Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **IP Tracking**: Monitoring and logging of request origins

## Security Configuration Requirements

### Database Configuration (Manual Steps Required)
The following security configurations require manual setup in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Auth OTP Expiry**: 
   - Go to Authentication > Settings in Supabase dashboard
   - Reduce OTP expiry time to recommended threshold (15 minutes or less)
   - [Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#security)

2. **Leaked Password Protection**:
   - Go to Authentication > Settings in Supabase dashboard
   - Enable "Password strength and leaked password protection"
   - [Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection)

3. **Extensions in Public Schema**:
   - Review database extensions in SQL Editor
   - Move extensions from public schema to appropriate system schemas
   - [Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0014_extension_in_public)

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logs
The system maintains comprehensive audit logs in the `audit_logs` table:
- User actions and admin operations
- IP addresses and timestamps
- Resource access and modifications
- Failed authentication attempts

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is implemented for:
- Newsletter subscriptions: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- Database operations through secure functions
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit records

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Security Reviews**: Conduct monthly security audits
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
3. **Access Control**: Regularly review user roles and permissions
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
5. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain secure backups with encryption

## Incident Response

In case of security incidents:
1. Document the incident in audit logs
2. Review affected systems and data
3. Implement immediate containment measures
4. Update security measures as needed
5. Conduct post-incident review
