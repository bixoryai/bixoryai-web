# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the BIXORY AI project and provides guidance for maintaining security best practices.

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All database tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies:

- **ai_tools**: Admin-only management, public read access for active tools
- **profiles**: Users can only access their own profiles, admins can view all
- **user_roles**: Users can view their own roles, admins can manage all roles
- **newsletter_subscribers**: Public subscription, admin-only viewing
- **rate_limits**: System-only access via secure functions
- **audit_logs**: Admin-only viewing, system can insert logs

### Rate Limiting
- Newsletter subscriptions: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- Implemented via secure database function: `check_rate_limit()`
- Automatic cleanup of old rate limit records

### Audit Logging
- All AI tools changes are automatically logged
- Admin actions are tracked with IP addresses and timestamps
- Audit logs table: `audit_logs`

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles
- **admin**: Full system access, can manage AI tools and view analytics
- **user**: Standard user access
- Role management via `user_roles` table and `has_role()` function

### Admin Protection
- Admin routes protected via `AdminRoute` component
- Database functions validate admin access
- Edge functions use JWT verification where appropriate

## Edge Functions Security

### Newsletter Functions
- **newsletter-subscribe**: Public access with rate limiting
- **send-newsletter**: Requires JWT authentication (admin only)
- **unsubscribe**: Public access for user convenience

### Input Validation
- All inputs sanitized and validated
- Email regex validation
- HTML content sanitization in newsletters
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

## Security Configuration Issues (Requires Manual Fix)

The following issues require manual configuration in Supabase Dashboard:

### 1. Auth OTP Expiry (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
**Action Required**: 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Reduce OTP expiry time to recommended values (e.g., 10 minutes)

### 2. Leaked Password Protection (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: Leaked password protection is disabled
**Action Required**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Enable "Password breach protection"
3. This prevents users from using known compromised passwords

### 3. Extensions in Public Schema (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: Database extensions installed in public schema
**Action Required**:
1. Review extensions in Supabase Dashboard → Database → Extensions
2. Consider moving system extensions to appropriate schemas
3. This is a database organization best practice

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never bypass RLS policies** - Always test with actual user contexts
2. **Validate all inputs** - Use the validation utilities in `src/utils/inputValidation.ts`
3. **Log security events** - Use the audit logging system for sensitive operations
4. **Test authentication flows** - Verify admin routes and permissions

### For Operations
1. **Monitor audit logs** regularly for suspicious activity
2. **Review rate limiting** effectiveness periodically
3. **Update dependencies** regularly for security patches
4. **Test backup and recovery** procedures

## Security Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Discovered
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected functionality if critical
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Fix**: Apply patches and updates
4. **Monitor**: Watch for continued issues
5. **Document**: Update this security documentation

### Contact Information

## Regular Security Tasks

### Monthly
- [ ] Review audit logs for anomalies
- [ ] Check rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Update dependencies

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security review
- [ ] Penetration testing consideration
- [ ] Review and update this documentation

## Compliance Notes

This system implements security measures appropriate for:
- General data protection
- User privacy protection
- Business application security

For specific compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.), additional measures may be needed.
